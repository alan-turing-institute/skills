# How to issue DOIs for Skills materials & Cite them 

At the Turing, we use [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), an open access repository developed by the European OpenAIRE program and operated by CERN, allowing researchers, trainers and team members to share and trace impact for presentations, training courses, datasets, reports, deliverables and publications. This in turn facilitates the ease of access of this information to the wider scientific community. 

Everything we upload at the Turing is Open Access under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence, and for now all our materials are only in English. 

## What do we upload
- posters & presentations (in PDF or editable format)
- datasets (in .csv format)
- images (in .png format)
- video recordings
- lessons (in ? format)
- other: can we upload .md files or Jypyter books? GitHub repos?

## Access levels
? Can anyone upload a file within a community?

## Guidance for uploading on Zenodo
- **Titles**: use descriptive titles that are consistent between different resources, and that are easy to find by others in the community
- **Publication date**: use the date when the materials were shared for the first time e.g., when you shared a presentation, launched a product etc.
