At the Turing, we use [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), an open access repository developed by the European OpenAIRE program and operated by CERN, allowing researchers, trainers and team members to share and trace impact for presentations, training courses, datasets, reports, deliverables and publications. This in turn facilitates the ease of access of this information to the wider scientific community.
