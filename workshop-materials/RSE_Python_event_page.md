## :dart: About the hands-on sessions 

During the hands-on sessions you will be allocated in groups of 5-6 people. The instructors will open the breakout rooms and allow you to choose your own room. If you don't get a pop-up message or you had to rejoin the meeting, click Breakout Room and then click Join as you hover over the number of participants in the relevant room.

In the first session, use the icebreaker questions below to get to know each other.. and feel free to go beyond these questions.

> **Icebreaker questions**
> 
> Introduce yourself - what organisation you're from, what is your field of work
> 
> Why did you decide to attend the course
> 
> If you could live in any country, which country would you pick?

## :exclamation: Code of conduct

We are very keen to ensure that you both benefit from training and feel part of the community, and if you think you experienced any harassment, discomfort, or anything else caused by the instructors, your peers, the course materials or the training team, please get in touch by email at training@turing.ac.uk. There is no formal process of reporting incidents and we will assess each case individually. We will also ensure confidentiality where it's appropriate.

As a general guideline, we try to abide to the Turing Way Code of Conduct principles, which you can read [here](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coc/coc-details.html).

We can only improve and ensure you are having a good experience if you let us know what might have gone wrong or just felt exclusionary. We'd be pleased not receive any complaints, but as you well know, that doesn't always mean everything is perfect - so let's work together to make the Learning at the Turing space is as inclusive as possible.
