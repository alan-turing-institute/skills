#  The Alan Turing Institute: Learning at the Turing 


This platform aims to offer an online open-access tool where researchers, academics, data scientists, instructors and relevant communities can contribute to the  data science and AI training agenda. The long term goal is to enable a more inclusive environment, and to improve the training provision nationally and beyond.

### About

[The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) was established as a *collaboration space* and national data science and AI convener, with the aim of becoming better than the sum of the parts - the university and business partners. As such, the Turing is well placed to convene the development and delivery of innovative training, in conjuction with the wider community. The ultimate aim is to set educational standards, and to offer a wide range of training opportunities for anyone interested in either teaching or learning data science and AI.

### Guiding principles

1. **Open access to all** - We believe that training opportunities should be open to everyone, irrespective of their financial, socioeconomic or academic situation. 
2. **Enabling a community of trainers** - As a national institute in data science and AI, we can only offer training to the wider community if we adopt a train-the-trainer approach whereby today's learners are tomorrow's instructors. 
3. **Opportunity to shape out the training agenda** - Through this project, we want to offer a platform through which interested individuals can find guidance and tools to contribute to training, allowing you to take part in shaping out the data science and AI training agenda in the UK.

# Contributing

This repository is always a work in progress and **everyone** is encouraged to help us develop and deliver training resources that will be useful to the wider community of learners.

**How can I get involved?**

- **Suggest training ideas:** Have an idea for some training that you and/ or others would find useful? Let us know.
- **Design a training activity:** Do you have an idea and the domain expertise to design a training activity or resource, but you don't have the time to actually develop the training materials? We want to hear about it.
- **Develop training materials:** Do you have some spare time and would like to contribute to open education? We would love to have you on board.
- **Deliver training in your community**: Would you like to use any of the training resources part of the *Learning at the Turing* portfolio? Feel free to use them as you see suited, and let us know if and how you may have found them useful!
- **Peer Review:** Do you know a bit about a certain training topic? Do you have some time to go through the existing materials and would like raise any issues, flag up any bugs, or update some of the examples we use? We are keen to hear from you - *peer-reviewers are crucial to this project*!
- **Share your existing training materials:** Do you have some training which is ready to share with the open community? We welcome any training ideas that align with our topics of interest.

### Improvements

This platform is currently under construction and as such we welcome any feedback and suggestions for improvement. We encourage you to open a new issue and label it as *improvements* or email us at training@turing.ac.uk
